    "    purposes i.e. they are deigned to analyse data efficiently. The queries used in these systems are \n",
    "    generally complex as these are used to do complex operations to analyse the data. The space \n",

    " →→@  Subject-oriented: A data warehouse should contain information about a few well- defined \n",
    "subjects rather than the enterprise.\n",
    " →→@  Integrated: A data warehouse is an integrated repository of data. It contains information \n",
    "from various systems within an organisation.\n",
    " →→@  Non-volatile: The data values in a database cannot be changed without a valid reason.\n",

    "     Select operation means selecting the datawhich we want to analyse.\n",
    "     Extract operation includes connecting to the data source and pulling out the data.\n",
    "     Transform operation includes converting the data into a standard form before pushing the \n",
    "     data in to a schema. Load means loading the data into data warehouse"
